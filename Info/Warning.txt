You can experience errors related to making requests (even after setting the appropriate headers) for one of the following reasons:

1) The URL is unreachable (e.g. the site is down, or they have blocked access to the CORS Anywhere IP).
2) Too many requests have been sent to CORS Anywhere by the given origin within the given time frame.
3) The URL itself is blacklisted.
4) CORS Anywhere is down. (i.e. this is applicable if you are self hosting)

You can swap commented and uncommmented 'getSongs' function in apiService.js for testing purposes.
